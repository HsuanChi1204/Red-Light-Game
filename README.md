## Inspiration
The Red Light Game: Stop, Think, Win! was inspired by the intense TV series *Squid Game* and cherished childhood memories of playing red light, green light in the park near my home. The blend of nostalgia and adrenaline fueled my desire to create a game that’s both fun and strategic.

## What It Does
The game recreates the excitement of the classic red light, green light game, with modern twists and challenges. Players must navigate through obstacles and reach the goal while adhering to movement restrictions—testing their reflexes and decision-making skills.

## How We Built It
The project was built using a combination of tools and technologies:

- **Frontend**: Developed with Three.js for immersive 3D gameplay.
- **Backend**: Leveraged AWS tools such as DynamoDB for leaderboard storage, IAM for secure permissions, API Gateway for managing requests, and S3/CloudFront for hosting game assets.
- **Game Logic**: Designed and implemented dynamic challenges using JavaScript and GLTF models.

## Challenges We Ran Into
Integrating AWS services as a beginner proved challenging, especially in ensuring seamless API communication and data consistency. Debugging and translating creative ideas into functioning code required significant time and patience.

## Accomplishments That We're Proud Of
We successfully built an engaging, visually immersive game while integrating multiple AWS services for robust functionality. It was rewarding to see the game transition from a concept to a playable experience.

## What We Learned
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with AWS tools, learned to tackle complex debugging processes, and developed a deeper understanding of how to implement game logic in code. The journey honed both my technical and problem-solving skills.

## What's Next for Red Light Game: Stop, Think, Win!
Future updates may include:

- Adding multiplayer functionality for competitive gameplay.
- Incorporating new levels with varied challenges.
- Enhancing the UI/UX for a more seamless player experience.
- Integrating mobile compatibility to expand accessibility.

This is just the beginning, and I’m excited to continue evolving the game to reach more players!
